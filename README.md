# Archived, delegated/delegating or Ceased projects
This personal folder is for my projects which are in the 'Archived', 'passed off/looking to pass off' or 'ceased' states.<br>
Go [here](https://github.com/8BtS-Ar-to-C) for project list.
- Definitions:
  - archived: Work on the project is indefinitely stopped with **no** chance of it being continued. (For when a project is too old to be maintained, not worth it anymore to maintain or there is not enough material/time available to maintain without hindering other projects quality with effectively no chance of said material/time becoming avalible.)
  
  - Delegated/Delegating: Work on the project has been moved to someone else or is up for 'adoption' and I'm no longer responsible for maintaining the project.
  
  - Ceased: Work on the project is indefinitely stopped due to legal issues with **no** chance of it being continued **unless** the relevant legal issue is resolved in the projects favour. The project should either **only** contain information from the project with no code, or the project **must** be privated if the code is to remain for any reason. (Items in this state should **only** be here if the project has been stopped for **any** legal means).
